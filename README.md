# license


## A collection of open source licenses

The licenses are part of a new project called <a href="http://www.github.com/BenLowery/john" >john</a>. As i couldn't find a repo which contained all these licenses, i decided to create my own.

#### Notes
* You need to add your name and year to the top of some files as it is currently placeholders.
* The files are in lower case so it's easier to request them.
* Some of the license names have been shortened for ease of understanding.s
